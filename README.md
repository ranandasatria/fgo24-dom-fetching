# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

This project showcases a list of characters from the Rick and Morty universe using data fetched from the Rick and Morty API. It is built using HTML and CSS for structure and styling, and JavaScript for fetching data and dynamically rendering content to the DOM.

Each character is displayed with an image and name in a responsive grid layout, showing three characters per row.
